# Microsoft-SQL-server---adventure-works

About 11 data extraction codes were written to extract various data from the adventure works database containing a lot of different tables.
Some of the data extracted is as follows:

1. How many people in the database do not have middlename?
2. How many email addresses do not end in adventure-works.com?
3. A customer has concerns with market penetration and would like a report on what states have the most sales between 2010 - 2011.
    Provide the data that the customer would find most relevant and add any additional information if required.
4. A ticket is escalated and asks what customers got the email promotion. please provide the information.

Just to mention but a few, a lot more data extration was carried out by me from this adventure works database. You would want to take a look at them.

Thanks.
